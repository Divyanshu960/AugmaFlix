INTRODUCTION

A new and different way of watching any video by experiencing the world of Agumented reality. There many things now that your hands can do not just your day to day tasks but also to interact with the Virtual world. 

About the code:-

The code is mainly written in C sharp and focuses on objects and their classes. Basically the object oriented strengths of the language are mostly used.
Vuforia a free software tool mainly used for agumented reality is mainly used for implementation with the help of unity for objcet placement and manipulation.

Working:-

At fist for projecting the image a unique base is chosen of highest strength (5 star) is chosen and then uploaded in the databse of vuforia which calculates the greyscale and bit range of the image.
Then in Unity the database which was created in vuforia is being transferred and then placed in the plane and all other factors like lighting, contrast and various other factors are Modified or adjusted.
Then using C sharp we give funcionality to the Objects which are in Agumented reality.

Contibutions:-

Any changes or advancements are appriciated.
Thank you.
